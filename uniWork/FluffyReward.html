            <p>
                Fluffy has gone missing. She is normally pretty laid back, but recently seemed agitated and may have gone off on a road
                trip.<br><br>
                
                Please keep an eye out for her. And sorry, but I just got back from Japan and I need to unload some yen. Hope you don't
                mind the currency!
            </p>

            <p>
                In this particular pose she seems to be more relaxed than I had seen her for some time before her sudden disappearance.

                If you happen to see her, please let me know. Call, 
                or feel free to drop by, especially if you have Fluffy with you!
