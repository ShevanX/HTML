    <h1>Illustrating some CSS Styles</h1>

    <h4>
        Let's describe this web page. First, the background image file for the page body is bluepaper.jpg and the body text is
        Arial with color blue in the default font size. The body also has a 20 pixel margin on all sides. The body content
        begins with an h1 element having a yellow background, centered text, and 20 pixels of padding top and bottom. Next is
        this h4 element you are reading, with its lightgrey background, brown text, and 20-pixel padding all all around.
        Following this is a floated-left image that occupies 40% of the body's width and has a 10 pixel right margin to separate
        it from the two paragraphs on its right. Both of those paragraphs contain justified text, and the second is indented by
        50 pixels to distinguish it from the first. The last thing on the page is an h3 element having white text with a
        20-pixel top margin and containing identification information.

    <p>
        There are some "cat people" and some "dog people". Cats, of course, have never been the same since they learned that a
        dog is "man's best friend". That may explain why they tend to ignore us most of the time.
    </p>
    <p class="side"> Whether you would like Bowser (shown at the left) as your best friend is of course open for debate. It's hard to tell
        what's on his mind. He may be just taking it easy, or ready for action at a moment's notice.
    </p>
